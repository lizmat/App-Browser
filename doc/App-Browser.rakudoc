=head1 NAME

App::Browser - OS independent interface to a browser

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use App::Browser;

browse('raku.org');             # visit the Raku web site with default browser

browse('raku.org', 'firefox');  # visit the Raku web site with Firefox

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

App::Browser provides a simple generic interface to starting a browser
for a given URL.  It exports the C<browse> function that takes a C<URL>
as the first parameter, and an optional browser identification as a
second parameter (which defaults to the C<APP_BROWSER> environment variable).

The C<browse> function returns a C<Proc> object, or C<Nil> if something
went wrong.  Whether it makes sense to do something with that object, is
unsure.

It also exports a command line script C<browse> that will take a C<URL>
and an optional browser identifier (e.g. C<chrome>, C<firefox>, C<safari>).

=begin output

$ browse raku.org

$ APP_BROWSER=chrome browse raku.org

$ browse raku.org firefox

=end output

=head1 WORK IN PROGRESS

Please note that this is a continuing work in progress.  At the moment of
this writing, only C<MacOS> is supported.  Specifically the different ways
of opening browsers on C<Windows> and the various tastes of C<Linux> will
need some experienced users to get this right.
